			<p><code>Documentation</code> is any communicable material that is used to describe, explain or instruct regarding some <code>attributes</code>
			of an object,
			system or procedure, such as its parts, assembly, installation, maintenance and use. Documentation can be provided on paper, online, or on
			digital or analog media, such as audio tape or CDs. Examples are user guides, white papers, online help, and quick-reference guides. Paper or
			hard-copy documentation has become less common. Documentation is often distributed via websites, software products, and other online applications
			.</p>
			<p>Documentation as a set of instructional materials shouldn't be confused with documentation science, the study of the recording and retrieval
			of information.</p>

			<p>While associated <code>ISO</code> standards are not easily available publicly, a guide from other sources for this topic may serve the purpose.</p>	
			<p>Documentation development may involve document drafting, formatting, submitting, reviewing, approving, distributing, reposting and tracking,
			etc., and are convened by associated <code>SOPs</code> in a regulatory industry. It could also involve creating content from scratch. Documentation should be
			easy to read and understand. If it's too long and too wordy, it may be misunderstood or ignored. Clear, concise words should be used, and
			sentences should be limited to a maximum of 15 words. Documentation intended for a general audience should avoid gender-specific terms and
			cultural biases. In a series of procedures, steps should be clearly numbered.</p>

			<p>Technical writers and corporate communicators are professionals whose field and work is documentation. Ideally, technical writers have a
			background in both the subject matter and also in writing, managing content, and information architecture. Technical writers more commonly
			collaborate with subject matter experts (SMEs), such as engineers, technical experts, medical professionals, etc. to define and then create
			documentation to meet the user's needs. Corporate communications includes other types of written documentation, for example:</p>	
				<ul>
				<li><code>Market communications</code> (MarCom): MarCom writers endeavor to convey the company's value proposition through a variety of
				print, electronic,
				and social media. This area of corporate writing is often engaged in responding to proposals.</li>
				<li><code>Healthcare documentation</code>: This field of documentation encompasses the timely recording and validation of events that have
				occurred during
				the course of providing health care.</li>
				<li><code>Technical communication</code> (TechCom): Technical writers document a company's product or service. Technical publications can
				include user
				guides, installation and configuration manuals, and troubleshooting and repair procedures.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>The following are typical software documentation types:</p>	
			<ul>
			<li>Request for Proposal</li>
			<li>Software Design and Functional Specification</li>
			<li>System Design and Functional Specifications</li>
			</ul>

			<p>A common type of software document written in the simulation industry is the SDF. When developing software for a simulator, which can range
			from embedded avionics devices to 3D terrain databases by way of full motion control systems, the engineer keeps a notebook detailing the
			development "the build" of the project or module. The document can be a wiki page, MS word document or other environment. They should contain a
			requirements section, an interface section to detail the communication interface of the software. Often a notes section is used to detail the
			proof of concept, and then track errors and enhancements.</p>
			<p>Finally, a testing section to document how the software was tested. This documents conformance to the client's requirements. The result is a
			detailed description of how the software is designed, how to build and install the software on the target device, and any known defects and
			work-arounds. This build document enables future developers and maintainers to come up to speed on the software in a timely manner, and also 
			provides a roadmap to modifying code or searching for bugs.</p>

				<p>These software tools can automatically collect data of your network equipment. The data could be for inventory and for configuration
				information. The ITIL Library requests to create such a database as a basis for all information for the IT responsible. It's also the basis
				for IT documentation. Examples include XIA Configuration.</p>
